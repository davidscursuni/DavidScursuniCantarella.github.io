                </header>
                <p>I was born in the shadow of Mount Etna, where the earth breathes fire and resilience runs through the veins. In Catania, my Italian-Romanian heritage shaped a curious mind and a restless spirit, nurtured by two cultures and the rhythms of a vibrant island. Life then took me to Milan, a city of elegance and ambition, where I immersed myself in the intricate world of international relations and diplomacy, charting paths between cultures and ideas. </p>
                <p>Languages have always been my compass. Italian is my foundation, English my bridge to the world, Spanish my dance partner, and Romanian my connection to my mother’s roots. German is my current challenge, a language I’m shaping into another tool for expression as I progress towards fluency.</p>
                <p>June 2024 marked a turning point. I stood before Italy’s diplomatic selection process, a trial of intellect and willpower, and though the outcome wasn’t what I had envisioned, it opened my eyes to a new possibility: diplomacy wasn’t the only way to build bridges. I found myself captivated by the world of data, a realm where the unseen becomes clear, where patterns emerge from chaos, and where insights drive decisions.</p>
                <p>Numbers, like languages, have their own syntax and rhythm, and I’ve become fluent. Armed with a Google Project Management Certificate and expertise in Excel, Tableau, and SQL, I’ve translated complexity into clarity and uncovered stories hidden in datasets. What began as curiosity soon became a purpose: to make data not just accessible, but impactful.</p>
                <p>Berlin is now my home, a city of contrasts, where innovation dances with history. It mirrors my journey: rooted in tradition yet always looking forward.</p>
                <p>Along the way, I’ve collected passions that fuel me: the thrill of motorsports, the alchemy of creating flavors in the kitchen, the endless inspiration of travel, and the fascinating interplay of power and strategy in geopolitics.</p>
                <p>I’m not just seeking a career; I’m building a narrative, one where data and creativity intertwine. I’m ready to take on challenges, disrupt the ordinary, and grow in a dynamic professional arena. My story is still being written, and I hope the next chapter is one we’ll write together.</p>
